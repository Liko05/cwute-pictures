Image uploading service
This project is really simple.
It consists of desktop client app to take and upload screenshots and a web server that takes care of saving images to a "database" and
displays them to user after getting get request on some specific url.

Server uses node.js with express framework.
Application is written in native c# and installed NewtonSoft JSON library.

You can try this app on this url [https://cwute.systems](https://cwute.systems) (This will be running only till July 20, 2022 after that i will stop paying for hosting it since it was just school project and never was meant to be like some actual project)
